# ‚úÖ VPC Module ‚Äì Troubleshooting Guide

> A comprehensive guide for identifying and resolving issues when working with the Terraform VPC module (VPC, subnets, IGW, NAT, route tables, and associations).

---

## üéØ Objective

This guide is designed to help DevOps engineers:

- Understand common pitfalls when deploying a VPC with Terraform
- Resolve routing and networking errors in AWS
- Avoid misconfigurations in subnets, NAT gateways, and route tables
- Build reliable and reusable Terraform VPC modules

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem 1: `RouteAlreadyExists`

**Explanation**  
Every VPC automatically includes a **local route** for its own CIDR block (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`). Adding this route manually in your route tables causes duplication.

**Fix**  

```hcl
# ‚ùå Wrong
route {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
  nat_gateway_id = aws_nat_gateway.my-nat-gw.id
}

# ‚úÖ Correct
route {
  cidr_block     = "0.0.0.0/0"
  nat_gateway_id = aws_nat_gateway.my-nat-gw.id
}
‚ö†Ô∏è Problem 2: Unexpected Identity Change
Explanation
Terraform‚Äôs state may lose identity values (id=null) while AWS returns valid resource IDs. This usually happens due to interrupted runs or provider bugs.

Fix

bash
Copy code
# 1. Refresh state
terraform refresh

# 2. Import the resource if missing
terraform import module.vpc.aws_route_table.private_rt rtb-xxxxxxxx

# 3. Upgrade AWS provider
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = ">= 5.58.0"
    }
  }
}
terraform init -upgrade

# 4. Last resort: remove from state and delete manually in AWS
terraform state rm module.vpc.aws_route_table.private_rt
‚ö†Ô∏è Problem 3: InvalidAMIID.NotFound
Explanation
AMI IDs are region-specific. An AMI from us-east-1 will not exist in ap-south-1.

Fix

bash
Copy code
# Check AMI availability
aws ec2 describe-images --image-ids ami-xxxxxx --region ap-south-1
Or fetch AMI dynamically:

hcl
Copy code
data "aws_ami" "ubuntu" {
  most_recent = true
  owners      = ["099720109477"] # Canonical

  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-*"]
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
  instance_type = "t3.micro"
}
‚ö†Ô∏è Problem 4: NAT Gateway Creation Fails
Explanation
NAT Gateways must be in a public subnet (with an IGW). Creating one in a private subnet fails.

Fix

hcl
Copy code
resource "aws_nat_gateway" "my-nat-gw" {
  allocation_id = aws_eip.my-nat-gw-eip.id
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.public_subnet.id

  depends_on = [aws_internet_gateway.my-igw] # ensure IGW exists first
}
‚ö†Ô∏è Problem 5: Subnet Instances Have No Internet
Explanation

Public subnet must route to IGW.

Private subnet must route to NAT GW.

Missing associations break connectivity.

Fix

hcl
Copy code
# Public Route Table
route {
  cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
  gateway_id = aws_internet_gateway.my-igw.id
}

# Private Route Table
route {
  cidr_block     = "0.0.0.0/0"
  nat_gateway_id = aws_nat_gateway.my-nat-gw.id
}

# Associations
resource "aws_route_table_association" "public_rt_assoc" {
  subnet_id      = aws_subnet.public_subnet.id
  route_table_id = aws_route_table.public_rt.id
}

resource "aws_route_table_association" "private_rt_assoc" {
  subnet_id      = aws_subnet.private_subnet.id
  route_table_id = aws_route_table.private_rt.id
}
‚ö†Ô∏è Problem 6: Destroy Fails With Dangling Resources
Explanation
Sometimes dependencies (NAT ‚Üí EIP ‚Üí IGW) don‚Äôt destroy in the right order.

Fix

bash
Copy code
# Destroy NAT first
terraform destroy -target=module.vpc.aws_nat_gateway.my-nat-gw

# Then clean up everything else
terraform destroy
If resources remain in AWS, delete them manually and refresh Terraform state:

bash
Copy code
terraform refresh
‚úÖ Best Practices Summary
Resource	Best Practice
VPC	Use a clear CIDR (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16)
Subnets	Split into /24 ranges per AZ
Internet Access	Public RT ‚Üí IGW, Private RT ‚Üí NAT GW
NAT Gateway	Place only in public subnet
Provider	Keep region only in root provider
State Drift	Use terraform import to re-sync
