# ‚úÖ Terraform VPC ‚Äì Troubleshooting Guide

> A comprehensive guide for identifying and resolving issues when creating a VPC with Terraform (VPC, subnets, IGW, NAT, route tables, and associations).

---

## üéØ Objective

This guide is designed to help DevOps engineers and cloud practitioners:

- Understand common pitfalls when deploying a VPC in AWS
- Resolve subnet, route table, and NAT gateway errors
- Avoid state drift and provider issues
- Build a reusable and reliable VPC module

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem 1: `RouteAlreadyExists`

**Explanation**:  
AWS automatically adds a **local route** for the VPC CIDR (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`).  
Manually adding the same route in a route table causes duplication.

**Fix**:

```hcl
# ‚ùå Wrong
route {
  cidr_block     = "10.0.0.0/16"
  nat_gateway_id = aws_nat_gateway.my-nat-gw.id
}

# ‚úÖ Correct
route {
  cidr_block     = "0.0.0.0/0"
  nat_gateway_id = aws_nat_gateway.my-nat-gw.id
}
‚ö†Ô∏è Problem 2: Unexpected Identity Change
Explanation:
Terraform state has id=null for a resource while AWS API returns a valid ID.
This happens after interrupted runs, state corruption, or provider bugs.

Fix:

bash
Copy code
# Refresh state
terraform refresh

# Import resource
terraform import module.vpc.aws_route_table.private_rt rtb-xxxxxxxx

# Upgrade provider
terraform init -upgrade

# Last resort: remove from state
terraform state rm module.vpc.aws_route_table.private_rt
‚ö†Ô∏è Problem 3: InvalidAMIID.NotFound
Explanation:
AMI IDs are region-specific. An AMI in us-east-1 won‚Äôt exist in ap-south-1.

Fix:

bash
Copy code
# Verify AMI in region
aws ec2 describe-images --image-ids ami-xxxxxx --region ap-south-1
Or fetch dynamically:

hcl
Copy code
data "aws_ami" "ubuntu" {
  most_recent = true
  owners      = ["099720109477"] # Canonical

  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-*"]
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
  instance_type = "t3.micro"
}
‚ö†Ô∏è Problem 4: NAT Gateway Creation Failed
Explanation:
NAT Gateways must be created in a public subnet with an Internet Gateway.
Placing it in a private subnet or missing IGW causes failure.

Fix:

hcl
Copy code
resource "aws_nat_gateway" "my-nat-gw" {
  allocation_id = aws_eip.my-nat-gw-eip.id
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.public_subnet.id

  depends_on = [aws_internet_gateway.my-igw]
}
‚ö†Ô∏è Problem 5: Instances Have No Internet Access
Explanation:

Public subnets require a route to the Internet Gateway.

Private subnets require a route to the NAT Gateway.

Missing associations cause connectivity issues.

Fix:

hcl
Copy code
# Public route table
route {
  cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
  gateway_id = aws_internet_gateway.my-igw.id
}

# Private route table
route {
  cidr_block     = "0.0.0.0/0"
  nat_gateway_id = aws_nat_gateway.my-nat-gw.id
}
And associate subnets properly:

hcl
Copy code
resource "aws_route_table_association" "public_rt_assoc" {
  subnet_id      = aws_subnet.public_subnet.id
  route_table_id = aws_route_table.public_rt.id
}

resource "aws_route_table_association" "private_rt_assoc" {
  subnet_id      = aws_subnet.private_subnet.id
  route_table_id = aws_route_table.private_rt.id
}
‚ö†Ô∏è Problem 6: Destroy Fails With Dangling Resources
Explanation:
NAT, EIP, and IGW may not destroy in the right order.

Fix:

bash
Copy code
# Destroy NAT first
terraform destroy -target=module.vpc.aws_nat_gateway.my-nat-gw

# Then destroy the rest
terraform destroy
If still stuck, delete resources manually in AWS console and refresh:

bash
Copy code
terraform refresh
‚úÖ Best Practices Summary
Resource	Best Practice
VPC	Use a clear CIDR (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16)
Subnets	Split into /24 ranges per AZ
Public Routing	Route ‚Üí IGW
Private Routing	Route ‚Üí NAT GW
NAT Gateway	Must be in public subnet
Provider Config	Keep region only in root provider
State Drift	Use terraform import to re-sync
